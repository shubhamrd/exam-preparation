### Set Your Deadline and Book Your Exam

Having a deadline is a powerful motivator. If you have an exam voucher, booking it first sets a clear target date for your studies. Don't have a voucher yet? No problem! Create a personal deadline and work backward. Allocate enough time based on your experience:

* **Cloud Newbies:** Aim for one month of dedicated preparation.
* **Cloud Familiar:**  Two weeks of focused studying should suffice.

Remember, the exam allows rescheduling 24 hours prior, so adjust as needed. Here's the link to book your exam:
